Chaining Animations with Event Listeners

4 must have JS event listeners:

animationstart fires at the start of an animation
animationend fires at the end of an animation
animationiteration fires at the end of each iteration of an animation
transitionend fires at the end of a transition

they will fire for every animation/transition on the element.
-> target with animation & transition name property

Exercise: Make Tuna Sit after Walking Animation Ends
