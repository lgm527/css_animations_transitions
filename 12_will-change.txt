will-change: css property
give heads up to browser about upcoming changes for optimization

over-optimization will lead to more latency

will-change: CSS property takes another CSS property

.in-view .animated-thing {
    will-change: transform;
}
.in-view .animated-thing:hover {
    transform: translateY(5%);
}

(this thing will transform so do some optimization)
(done at on at need basis right before change occurs, do not put it on everything)
